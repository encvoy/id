## Organization Login Methods { #organization-login-methods }

A **login method** is a user authentication method that allows them to log in to applications.

An organization can use both public login methods and login methods created specifically for that organization.

**You can:**

- Use **public login methods** configured by the **Encvoy ID** administrator
- Add **your own login methods** exclusively for your organization
- Configure **publicity** — determine where your login methods will be available
- Make identifiers **mandatory** for users

> ⚠️ **Restrictions:** Only **Encvoy ID** administrators can edit public login methods.

> 🔍 Detailed instructions for creating, editing, and deleting login methods are provided in the main guide: [Configuring Login Methods](./docs-06-github-en-providers-settings.md#managing-login-methods).
